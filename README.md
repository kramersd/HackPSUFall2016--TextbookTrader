Code / Project:
- Our code reflects a prototype Java applet that is meant to be imbedded into our website. It serves the functionality of providing a simple GUI interface for managing users and searching for textbooks. We utilized Netbeans 8.2 as our IDE for programing along with Java DB Derby for SQL management of our users, textbook listings, and textbooks owned by the user.
